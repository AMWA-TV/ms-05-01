# 11. Workflow Data

From time to time, it is necessary for devices to store and forward data about the production context in which they are working. NCA calls such data _workflow data_, and collections of such data _workflow datasets._

The NCA Workflow Data feature set provides the following services:

- Storage and retrieval of workflow datasets.
- Name-based management of multiple workflow datasets per device.
- Value-change notifications for changes in workflow dataset content.
- Status management of workflow datasets, e.g. an indicator of whether a dataset is active or inactive.
- Origin tracing and timestamping of workflow datasets.
- Uniform, unique identification of workflow datasets.
- Optional linkage of workflow datasets to particular points in media streams.

The feature set does not define the content, format, or meaning of workflow data - this is the province of other protocols.
