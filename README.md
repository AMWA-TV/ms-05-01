<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does it do?

It defines a system for modelling various types of devices which interrelates with existing NMOS Specifications and the JT-NM Reference Architecture.

### Why does it matter?

The modelling system can model actual devices on top of published classes and schemas, leading to at least basic interoperability between compatible devices. It also provides a way of conveying the model in a live system, including dynamic updates due to reconfiguration of the devices which can be consumed by a controller or management entity.

### How does it work?

The NMOS Control Architecture (NCA) defines class hierarchies, inheritance relationships, and also a powerful schema mechanism which can support the requirements of a modern modelling system.
